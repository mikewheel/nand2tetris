# Nand2Tetris Implementation

This repository contains my progress towards completing the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), 
created and maintained by Profs. Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The goal is to 
learn about computer systems "from the ground up" by building a fully-functional computer from primitive chips
 â€” specifically starting only with the [NAND gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate), hence the name. 
 
Included in this repository are the chip files written in a Hardware Description Language specific to this course. 
Together they comprise the "computer": the sum of the work that I did to implement the chips and follow along 
with the course. In order to execute any of these files a user must download the hardware simulator and other utilities
available at the course website linked above.
